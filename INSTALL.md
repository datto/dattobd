# dattobd INSTALL

## From Repositories
We recommend that you install the kernel module from Datto's repositories. Datto provides repos for RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, and Ubuntu LTS.

### RHEL/CentOS
The repository install package `datto-el-rpm-release` is available for EL6+.
```bash
sudo yum localinstall https://cpkg.datto.com/datto-rpm/EnterpriseLinux/$(rpm -E %rhel)/x86_64/datto-el-rpm-release-$(rpm -E %rhel)-8.1.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install dkms-dattobd dattobd-utils
```
### Fedora
The repository install package `datto-fedora-rpm-release` is available for F20+, excluding Rawhide.
```bash
sudo yum install https://cpkg.datto.com/datto-rpm/Fedora/$(rpm -E %fedora)/x86_64/datto-fedora-rpm-release-$(rpm -E %fedora)-8.1.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) dkms-dattobd dattobd-utils
```
### openSUSE
The repository install package `datto-opensuse-rpm-release` is available for openSUSE 13.1 and newer, excluding Tumbleweed and Factory.
Due to the DKMS software not being present in openSUSE's default repositories, the `X11:Bumblebee` or other similar repository providing
DKMS is required. The steps below assume no providers of DKMS are available, so it may not be necessary to add `X11:Bumblebee` if you can
already get DKMS through an already-installed repository.
#### openSUSE 13.1
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:Bumblebee/openSUSE_13.1/X11:Bumblebee.repo
sudo zypper install https://cpkg.datto.com/datto-rpm/openSUSE/13.1/x86_64/datto-opensuse-rpm-release-13.1-8.1.noarch.rpm
sudo zypper install dkms-dattobd dattobd-utils
```
#### openSUSE 13.2
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:Bumblebee/openSUSE_13.2/X11:Bumblebee.repo
sudo zypper install https://cpkg.datto.com/datto-rpm/openSUSE/13.2/x86_64/datto-opensuse-rpm-release-13.2-8.1.noarch.rpm
sudo zypper install dkms-dattobd dattobd-utils
```
#### openSUSE 42.1
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:Bumblebee/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/X11:Bumblebee.repo
sudo zypper install https://cpkg.datto.com/datto-rpm/openSUSE/42.1/x86_64/datto-opensuse-rpm-release-42.1-8.1.noarch.rpm
sudo zypper install dkms-dattobd dattobd-utils
```
### Ubuntu LTS
```bash
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 29FF164C
echo "deb https://cpkg.datto.com/repositories $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/datto-linux-agent.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dattobd-dkms dattobd-utils
```

These packages will install and configure the kernel module to start during the boot process. No further configuration should be required when installing using this method.


## From Source

### Dependencies

Note that this build process, while it _should_ work with any distribution, has only been tested with the distributions below.

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential
```

#### RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
```
sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

#### openSUSE/SLE
```
sudo zypper install kernel-default-devel
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_C_C++
```

### Getting, Building, and Installing
To retrieve the sources from our Git repository, clone the Git repository to your local computer.

`cd` into the directory created by git, and then run the following commands:
```bash
sudo make
sudo make install
```

### Configuring the Kernel Module
To start the kernel module immediately, run:
```bash
sudo insmod src/dattobd.ko
```

If you would like to have the module be loaded automatically during boot, consult the documentation for your distribution.

### Troubleshooting
On some systems, it may be necessary to let the system know of the location of the shared libraries. If you are having trouble getting `dbdctl` to run, run these two commands:
```
echo /usr/local/{lib,lib64} | sed 's/ /\n/g' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/dattobd.conf
sudo ldconfig
```

### Usage
The kernel module is primarily controlled through `dbdctl(8)`, which was installed previously. For usage instructions, see [dbdctl.8.md](doc/dbdctl.8.md).
